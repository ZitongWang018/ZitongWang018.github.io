Hello, I'm **Zitong Wang** (Chinese: 汪子桐), a sophomore student at the International School of Business and Finance, Sun Yat-sen University. I am pursuing a major in **Finance**, complemented by a minor in **Information and Computing Science**.

My career aspiration lies in Quantitative Finance, fueled by a keen interest in the cutting-edge developments of Deep Learning (DL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Currently, I am actively engaged in:

* Quantitative Research: Focusing on areas such as automated factor mining and CAT strategies.

* Vision-Language Models (VLMs): Exploring MLLMs understanding/reasoning, visual-text alignment, and related topics.

I'm always open to discussions and collaborations in these fields. Feel free to reach out to me via email!
