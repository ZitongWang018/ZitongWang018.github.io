I spent January and February 2026 interning at the LUMIA Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. It was a busy time focused on ICML submissions, where I finished a first-author paper on dLLM and a third-author paper on PonderLM, among others. I chatted a lot with the seniors and my mentor in the group and learned a great deal.

Outside the lab, I visited the Shanghai Institute of Innovation and toured around the city. I had a wonderful time with xvxv❤. We went café hopping, enjoyed a lot of Japanese food, and explored different cuisines. We even checked out the filming locations for The Good Days and B for Busy—seeing (exciting Lao Bai's house)

While Shanghai’s diverse and bustling city life is attractive, what really hooked me was the incredible research atmosphere and the powerful compute resources. To me, those are the real essentials for changing the world.
