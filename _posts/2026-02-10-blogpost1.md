I spent January and February 2026 interning at the LUMIA Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. It was a busy time focused on ICML submissions, where I finished a first-author paper on dLLM and a third-author paper on PonderLM, among others. I chatted a lot with the seniors and my mentor in the group and learned a great deal.

Outside the lab, I visited the Shanghai Institute of Innovation and toured around the city. I had a wonderful time with xvxv❤. We went café hopping, enjoyed a lot of Japanese food, and explored different cuisines. We even checked out the filming locations for The Good Days and B for Busy—seeing (exciting Lao Bai's house).

  <figcaption>On my first day in Shanghai, the flowers, strawberries, and roast lamb from xvxv saved a bad day; We went to a beef buffet—binging on grilled durian and Häagen-Dazs—went shopping, visited the Bund, drank Algebraist, and had DQ; xvxv brought a bunch of aliens (e.g. LingHongWen); We used water to leave proof of our love on the window.</figcaption>

While Shanghai's diverse and bustling city life is attractive, what really hooked me was the incredible research atmosphere and the powerful compute resources. To me, those are the real essentials for changing the world.

I wanna say thanks to xvxv. After some days it will be the Valentine's Day. During these days, I wake up every morning to find you sleeping beside me. We get up, have a simple meal, and then might head out or just stay indoors. I feel a simplicity that is filled with happiness.

When I stay up late working on my drafts, you give me endless encouragement and hugs, taking care of me and keeping me company. In the future, we may face various challenges, but I believe everything we encounter will guide us in the right direction. We are like two trees growing side by side: our roots are tightly intertwined underground, and our leaves greet each other in the clouds.

You always give me the courage and motivation to push beyond my limits. We will be even closer than Gu and Jia'er in luschuanshuo, and I feel so, so lucky to have you in my life.

As Tagore wrote in Stray Birds:

*"The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover. It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal."*
